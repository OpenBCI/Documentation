#### Returns

To initiate a return, contact us at [support@openbci.com.](mailto:support@openbci.com.) Refunds and exchanges can be requested within 30 days of the delivery date.

Please note, all returns are contingent on the resale-able condition of the items. The customer is responsible for the cost of return shipping.

#### Order Issues

If you received a damaged item, we will send a replacement at no additional charge, or refund the order in full, including shipping cost. OpenBCI must be notified as soon as possible after you receive your order, via [support@openbci.com](mailto:support@openbci.com).

#### How to Return or Exchange Items in 3 Simple Steps

1. Contact us at [support@openbci.com](mailto:support@openbci.com) indicating the issue or reason for return. We will provide the return shipping address.
2. Send us the items in the original box (or a different box, as long as it's unmarked) to the address below. We suggest you use USPS Priority Mail or a carrier that provides tracking. OpenBCI, Inc. is not responsible for lost shipments. If returning an order from outside the US, declare a low shipment value for customs, i.e. $10.
3. Email us to let us know when to expect the package.

#### If Youâ€™re Requesting a Refund

*We reserve the right to deduct up to 20% in restocking fees based on the date of return (if after 30 days) and the condition of the returned product, (i.e. if the product has been opened/used.)* The fee is subtracted from the amount of the refund. Shipping costs are not refunded. Single-use electrodes and electrode gel or paste CANNOT be returned/refunded if opened/used.

When the returned item is received, your original method of payment will be credited as soon as we have completed processing your return (usually within 2 weeks).

#### Policy Limitation

The product policy outlined above is applicable only to orders from shop.openbci.com. Because OpenBCI's hardware and software files are open-source, some companies use the files to make counterfeit biosensing products. They look similar to authentic OpenBCI products but do not function or meet expectations. We are unable to offer support on counterfeit or inauthentic products. 

OpenBCI manufactures biosensing boards at a dedicated facility in the United States. We use a strict quality-control system to ensure our customers receive high-quality, research-grade products.
