### How to Request a Return (for a Refund)

To initiate a return, please email us at [support@openbci.com](mailto:support@openbci.com) with your "return" + your order number in the subject line.

To qualify for a full refund, return requests must be submitted within 30 days of the delivery date. Refunds will be issued to the original form of payment once the return is processed—typically within two weeks of receipt.

Please note that all returns are subject to inspection and must be in a resellable condition. Returns requested after 30 days may be subject to a restocking fee of up to 20%, depending on the condition of the returned items. This fee will be deducted from the total refund amount.

Customers are responsible for return shipping costs. Returns requested more than 30 days after delivery are not guaranteed and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Orders delivered more than 90 days ago are not eligible for return or refund.

#### Non-Returnable Items

We do **not** accept returns for the following items if they have been opened or used:

- Ten20 Conductive Paste
- Electrode Cap Gel
- Gold Cup Electrodes
- Header Pin to Touch Proof Electrode Adapter
- EMG/ECG Snap Electrode Cables
- Kendall EMG/ECG Foam Solid Gel Electrodes
- Hydro-link Replacements

These items may only be returned if they are unused and in their original **sealed** packaging.

Additionally, returned OpenBCI boards that have been opened, tested, or used are subject to a 15% restocking and retesting fee, regardless of the return date.

### Received a Damaged or Defective Item?

If your item arrives damaged or defective, please notify us at [support@openbci.com](mailto:support@openbci.com) as soon as possible—and no later than 90 days after delivery. We will gladly send a replacement at no additional cost. Or, you can return the faulty item for a full refund, including shipping.

### Policy Limitation

This return policy applies only to purchases made directly through [shop.openbci.com](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage).

Because OpenBCI hardware and software files are open-source, some third-party manufacturers produce unauthorized replicas that resemble our products but do not meet our standards. These counterfeit items are not eligible for support, returns, or refunds. A valid OpenBCI order number is required to process any return or exchange.

All OpenBCI biosensing boards are manufactured at our dedicated U.S. facility using a rigorous quality control process to ensure you receive high-performance, research-grade technology.
