### How to Request a Return (for a Refund)
To initiate a return, please email us at [support@openbci.com](mailto:support@openbci.com) with your "return" + your order number in the subject line. 

To qualify for a full refund, return requests must be submitted within 30 days of the delivery date. Refunds will be issued to the original form of payment once the return is processed—typically within two weeks of receipt.

Please note that all returns are subject to inspection and must be in a resellable condition. Returns requested after 30 days may be subject to a restocking fee of up to 20%, depending on the condition of the returned items. This fee will be deducted from the total refund amount.

Customers are responsible for return shipping costs. Returns requested more than 30 days after delivery are not guaranteed and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Orders delivered more than 90 days ago are not eligible for return or refund.

#### *Non-Returnable Items
We do **not** accept returns for the following items if they have been opened or used:
* Ten20 Conductive Paste
* Electrode Cap Gel

* Header Pin to Touch Proof Electrode Adapter
* EMG/ECG Snap Electrode Cables

These items may only be returned if they are unused and in their original **sealed** packaging.

### Policy Limitation

This return policy applies only to purchases made directly through [shop.openbci.com](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage).

Because OpenBCI hardware and software files are open-source, some third-party manufacturers produce unauthorized replicas that resemble our products but do not meet our standards. These counterfeit items are not eligible for support, returns, or refunds. A valid OpenBCI order number is required to process any return or exchange.

All OpenBCI biosensing boards are manufactured at our dedicated U.S. facility using a rigorous quality control process to ensure you receive high-performance, research-grade technology.
