## Where do you ship to?

**ALL** OpenBCI orders ship from the US. We ship to all countries worldwide, except Russia.

## What are the shipping rates?

| ship method                                | delivery estimate |
| :----------------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| U.S. Domestic Ground (FedEx or UPS)        | 3-7 days          |
| International Economy (FedEx, UPS, or DHL) | 7-14 days         |
| International Express                      | 2-5 days          |

Orders are shipped 1-2 business days after payment. **ALL** orders include a tracking number, which is automatically emailed to the address you provide. This tracking number is usually made available within 2-3 business days.

Shipping is calculated based on several factors, including the size of the package, the postage carrier selected, and the destination. Shipping charges and delivery methods are shown at checkout. Note that shipping charges shown at checkout do not include unforeseen delivery costs such as import duties and customs taxes.

Generally, orders to US addresses are delivered within one week. If using FedEx International Economy (the recommended courier), allow up to 1-2 weeks for your order to arrive at customs clearance.

## Sales Tax

For customers in the United States, your purchase may be sales tax-free if made on behalf of a tax-exempt organization. Ask your purchasing department for the tax-exempt certificate BEFORE placing an order, and send it to [contact@openbci.com.](mailto:contact@openbci.com.) We do not refund sales taxes after purchase.

For other customers, sales tax will be calculated automatically according to the laws of the state in which you reside.

## Are duties and customs included in the shipping rate?

Countries outside the United States may be subject to import duties and customs taxes according to the laws of your country of residence. As the customer, you are responsible for these charges.

We will not intervene with customs procedures, per the import laws of your country of residence.

Please be advised that product prices do not include customs fees, taxes, brokerage fees, or any customs clearance fees. These are the responsibility of the customer.

If shipping to European countries, please expect the **total** import cost to be about 30% of the product price. For other countries, it is typically 10-20%.

The import cost will be calculated by your customs office at the time of delivery and passed on to you.
Due to the nature of international trade, OpenBCI has no control over these charges and can give only a rough estimate from historical purchase data. Because of varied customs policies, we are unable to provide exact predictions. Please contact your local customs office if you need exact import cost information.

Please note: duties, tariffs, and/or VAT fees may be NON-REFUNDABLE in case of a returned or lost order/shipment. OpenBCI cannot refund these costs. Customers must inquire with the customs office or shipment carrier about the possibility of a VAT refund in case of returned or failed shipment. For return eligibity for OpenBCI orders, please review our return policy [here](https://docs.openbci.com/FAQ/Returns/). 

_For international customers, if you are purchasing on behalf of an academic or tax-exempt organization, your purchase may be exempt from some import costs. Please verify with the purchasing department of your organization before placing the order._
