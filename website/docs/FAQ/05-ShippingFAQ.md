## Where do you ship to?

**ALL** OpenBCI orders ship from the US. We ship worldwide!

## What are the shipping rates?

Shipping is calculated based on a number of factors including the size of the package, the postage carrier selected, and the destination. Shipping charges and delivery methods are shown at checkout. Note that shipping charges shown at checkout do not include unforeseen delivery costs such as import duty and customs taxes.

Generally, orders to US addresses are delivered within one week. If using FedEx International Economy (the recommended courier), allow up to 1-2 weeks for your order to arrive at customs clearance. **ALL** orders include tracking number emailed automatically to an email you provide. This tracking number is usually made available within 2-3 business days.

## Sales Tax

For customers in the United States, your purchase may be sales tax-free if made on behalf of a tax-exempt organization. Ask your purchasing department for the tax-exempt certificate BEFORE placing an order, and send to [contact@openbci.com.](mailto:contact@openbci.com.) We do not refund sales taxes after purchase.

For other customers, the sales tax will be calculated automatically per the laws of the state you reside in.

## Are duties and customs included in the shipping rate?

Countries outside the United States may be subject to import duties and customs taxes per the laws of your country of residence. As the customer, you are responsible for these charges.

We will not intervene with customs procedures, per the import laws of your country of residence.

Please be advised that product prices do not include customs fees, taxes, brokerage fees, or any customs clearance fees. This is the responsibility of the customer.

If shipping to European countries, please expect the **total** import cost to be about 30% of the product price. For other countries, it is up to 10-20%.

The import cost will be calculated by your customs office at the time of delivery and passed onto you.
Due to the nature of international trade, OpenBCI has no control over these charges, and can give only a rough estimate from historical purchase data. Because of varied customs policies, we are unable to provide exact predictions. Please contact your local customs office if you need exact import cost information.

_For international customers, if you are purchasing on behalf of an academic or tax-exempt organization, your purchase may be exempt from some import costs. Please verify with the purchasing department of your organization before placing the order._
