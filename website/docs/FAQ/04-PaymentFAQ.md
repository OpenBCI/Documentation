Please note all orders ship **after** full payment. Orders cannot be split between multiple shipments.

We cannot guarantee that we can satisfy the request, but we will do our best if contacted in a timely fashion.

## How do I request a quotation or an invoice?

To receive a quote, please make a [customer account](https://shop.openbci.com/account/register) and add your shipping address to your account. You can add your address by clicking “view addresses” on the right hand side of the screen. Then click “Add a new address”. 

After this step is complete, please email us at [sales@openbci.com](mailto:sales@openbci.com) and provide the following info:
1. The email address associated with your OpenBCI account
2. The full list of products and quantities you’d like on your quote
  
You can find all of our products listed on our online store: shop.openbci.com 


## When will my credit card be charged?

Our store system will authorize your card the moment you place your order and a settlement (debit) will likely occur within 48 hours.
