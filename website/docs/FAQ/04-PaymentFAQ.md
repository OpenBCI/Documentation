## How do I request a quotation or an invoice?
There are two methods of getting a quotation. 

The first and faster method is to use the self-service quote tool on our [website](https://shop.openbci.com). Select the product you'd like a quote for and use the "Add to Quote" button (below the "Add to cart" button.) You can add multiple items to the quote by clicking "Continue Browsing". Once you have all items required added to the quote, click "Show Quote Cart" to finalize the quote. You will receive an email with the PDF quote. 

The second method-
 First, make a customer [account](https://shop.openbci.com/account/register) with your email and shipping address. 

After this step is complete, please email us at [sales@openbci.com](mailto:sales@openbci.com) and provide the following info:
1. The email address associated with your OpenBCI account
2. The full list of products and quantities you’d like on your quote

We will then follow up in 1-2 business days with a PDF quote.
  
You can find all of our products listed on our online store: shop.openbci.com 


## When will my credit card be charged?

Our store system will authorize your card when the order is submitted and a settlement (debit) would occur within 48 hours.
