# OpenBCI Experiment


Welcome to the OpenBCI Puppies and Kittens Experiment, designed by Fan Li.


During this experiment, you will watch a video containing images of puppies and kittens, and press a button every time you see a puppy in the image.


Below are the instructions on how to do it. Full information on this experiment can be found in [the OpenBCI Repository](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Experiment). Once you're comfortable with how the experiment works, you can modify the script to create your own experiments.

## Equipment Required

1.  **Headwear**, which can be:

    -   [Ultracortex Mark IV Headset](https://shop.openbci.com/products/ultracortex-mark-iv) with [Copper Wires](https://www.amazon.com/StrivedayTM-Flexible-Electric-electronic-electrics/dp/B01LH1FYHO/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2ANLHLBH5WL2Q&dchild=1&keywords=flexible+wire+22+gauge&qid=1598387126&s=hi&sprefix=flexible+wire+22+g%2Ctools%2C179&sr=1-3).

## Step 1: Headwear, Board and Software Setup


First, connect the headwear to yourself and the Cyton board, and read from it using the GUI. If you are using the Ultracortex, follow [this tutorial](AddOns/Headwear/01-Ultracortex-Mark-IV.md). If you're using the gold cup electrodes, follow [this guide](GettingStarted/Biosensing-Setups/01-EEG-Setup.md) to learn how to connect each electrode, and connect them in the positions you would like to measure EEG from. A good guide to the eight positions commonly used can be found in the Ultracortex tutorial. If you're using an electrode cap, follow [this tutorial](AddOns/Headwear/04-Electrode_Cap_Tutorial.md) to connect it.

## Step 2: Breadboard Setup


The diagram for the circuit with the photocell and the button can be found below.

<img src="https://github.com/OpenBCI/Documentation/blob/master/website/docs/assets/ExamplesImages/Circuit_Diagram.png?raw=true" width="70%" />


Using the components listed above, assemble the breadboard. You can find an example of how to assemble a button circuit using Arduino [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/button) and an example of how to assemble a photocell circuit [here](https://openbci.com/community/measuring-stimulus-timing-with-a-photoresistor/). The final breadboard should look similar to the pictures below.

<img src="https://github.com/OpenBCI/Documentation/blob/master/website/docs/assets/ExamplesImages/Breadboard_Setup.jpeg?raw=true" width="70%" />


Next, connect the breadboard to the Cyton board as shown below. Place the breadboard beside your computer so that the photocell points to the lower-left corner of your screen, which is where the video trigger will be located.

## Step 4: Run Experiment


Download [this video](https://github.com/evaesteban/OpenBCI_Experiment/blob/master/video.mp4). Once you're ready to start, press `Start Data Stream` in the GUI. Then, open the video and make it full-screen. Every time a puppy appears in the video, press the button. The video is around 3 minutes long. You're now ready to press play!

## Step 5: Retrieve Data


Once you've finished watching the video, press `Stop Data Stream`. In your /Documents/OpenBCI_GUI/Recordings folder, you should find the recorded data for that session.

## Step 6: Process Data

In [this Python notebook](https://github.com/evaesteban/OpenBCI_Experiment/blob/master/OpenBCI_Experiment_Toolkits.ipynb), you'll find sample code to read, plot, and analyze the recorded data. 

## Step 7: Create your Own Experiment

Once you understand how to conduct an experiment, you can modify [this Python script](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Experiment/blob/master/ExternalTriggerCreator_quick.py) to make your own video. The current code reads the images stored in the `Images` folder, shuffles them, and creates a video with 4 different sessions. Each session displays the images at a different rate. Each image has an embedded trigger and is separated from the others by a fixation cross.

The video pattern was created in accordance to the diagram below obtained from the research paper [Toward Emotion Aware Computing: An Integrated Approach Using Multichannel Neurophysiological Recordings and Affective Visual Stimuli](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5415563) by C. A. Frantzidis, C. Bratsas, C. L. Papadelis, E. Konstantinidis, C. Pappas and P. D. Bamidis, published in IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine, vol. 14, no. 3, pp. 589-597, May 2010.
