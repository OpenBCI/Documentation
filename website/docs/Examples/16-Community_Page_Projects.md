Head over to the [Community Page](http://www.openbci.com/community/) for project tutorials contributed by OpenBCI Community members! Use the "tutorials" tag to filter.

In the community page, search for "EMG OpenBCI" and you'll find, for example, how-tos on [EMG-controlled Neurobots Battle Royale](https://www.instructables.com/id/Neurobots-Battle-Royale-Muscle-Controlled-Combat-H/) and [EEG-controlled Shark](https://eeghacker.blogspot.com/2015/03/brain-controlled-shark-attack.html) as shown in [IEEE Spectrum.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/openbci-control-an-air-shark-with-your-mind)

You'll also find full walk-throughs on how to replicate award-winning SSVEP and P300-based neuroscience projects, such as the hands-free, brain-computer interface [speller](https://github.com/NTX-McGill/NeuroTechX-McGill-2021) by McGill University Neurotech, the SSVEP-based [communicator](https://github.com/WATOLINK/mind-speech-interface-ssvep) by University of Waterloo, and the P300-based [speller](https://github.com/DarrenVawter/P300_BCI/blob/main/README.md) by UCLA.
