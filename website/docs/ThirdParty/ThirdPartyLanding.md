The directory to the left contains documents to explain the integration between OpenBCI and compatible third-party hardware. This landing page summarizes the variety of sampling modalities!

## EmotiBit

Designed by our good friend Sean Montgomery and his team, [EmotiBit](https://emotibit.com) can stream 16+ signals from the body (EDA, 3-wavelength PPG, high-res body temperature, humidity and a 9-axis IMU). We think it's the perfect complement to add emotional, physiological and movement data to your EEG recordings!

EmotiBit is a wearable sensor module for capturing high-quality emotional, physiological, and movement data. Easy-to-use and scientifically-validated sensing lets you enjoy wireless data streaming to any platform or direct data recording to the built-in SD card. Customize the Arduino-compatible hardware and fully open-source software to meet any project needs!

The Pulse Sensor is one of the third-party add-ons offered in our store.

It can be connected to the [Ganglion](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/pre-order-ganglion-board), [Cyton](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/cyton-biosensing-board-8-channel), or any Arduino board to easily obtain your heart rate using [photoplethysmogram (PPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram).

## ThinkPulse Active Electrodes

We are very excited to partner with Conscious Labs to offer this affordable, high-quality biosensing kit to our community. The ThinkPulseâ„¢ kit offers research-grade dry, active electrode EEG sensors at an unprecedented price point and comfort level.
