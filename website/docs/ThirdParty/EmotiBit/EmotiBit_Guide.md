EmotiBit is a wearable sensor module for capturing high-quality emotional, physiological, and movement data. Easy-to-use and scientifically-validated sensing lets you enjoy wireless data streaming to any platform or direct data recording to the built-in SD card.

#### Purchase the [All-in-One EmotiBit Bundle](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/all-in-one-emotibit-bundle) or the [EmotiBit + Kit](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/emotibit) to get started!


### 16+ biometric data streams: 
* **PPG** (3-wavelength) to derive heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration, oxygen saturation, hydration and (we believe) much more!
* **EDA / GSR**(electrodermal activity / galvanic skin response) reflecting sympathetic nervous system responses that are driven by cognitive and emotional arousal.
* **9-axis IMU**(accel, gyro, mag) to derive movements, activity, gesture, rotation, and cardinal direction.
* **Body temperature** to assess health as well as emotional reactions.

### What can you do with EmotiBit?
Whether you're a researcher, developer, educator, artist, or just passionate about harnessing your own physiological data, the EmotiBit offers something for everyone! 

Get inspired by the example projects in the product images.

* Get immediate feedback about how cognitive and neural processes change your body’s physiology on a moment by moment basis.
* Log your physical and psycho-emotional changes throughout the day.
* Track changes in body temperature, blood oxygen levels, and much more to build a long-term record of your bio-data.
* Create an audio-visual experience using your own biometric data. 
* Data is accurately timestamped for synchronizing with other sensors/systems.
* Use the simple data labeling feature built into the cross-platform EmotiBit data visualizer to leverage data science and machine learning and discover your bio-patterns.

| ---        |    ----   |          --- |
| EmotiBit Emo            | <ul><li>PPG Sensor (3-wavelength) </li><li>EDA / GSR sensor (+AgCl snap electrodes)</li><li>9-axis IMU (Accel, Gyro, Mag)</li><li>Temperature sensor (standard-grade)</li><li>Numerous derivative biometric streams</li><li>Finger strap       | $249.99   |
| EmotiBit MD   |  <ul><li>**Everything** on EmotiBit Emo</li><li>**PLUS** a medical-grade temperature sensor (thermopile) for sensing even more accurate body temperature        | $349.99      |

###Do I need a kit?
You need several items in the Essentials Kit to use EmotiBit, including:

* Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi
* Lithium ion battery (400mAh sized to fit between the EmotiBit & Feather)
* High-speed microSD card + reader
* Micro USB cable

**We highly recommend you get an** [Essentials Kit](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/emotibit-essentials-kit?variant=42366414749936) to use EmotiBit out of the box, but we’re offering EmotiBit board-only options without a kit in case you already have all these parts or if you want to adapt the [EmotiBit firmware](https://github.com/EmotiBit/EmotiBit_FeatherWing) to use another Feather or configuration.

We also have an Electrode Kit for folks who want spares and additional flexibility to use EmotiBit in research and other high-use settings.
