EmotiBit is a wearable sensor module for capturing high-quality emotional, physiological, and movement data. Easy-to-use and scientifically validated sensing lets you enjoy wireless data streaming to any platform or direct data recording to the built-in SD card.

### Scientific validation

**Open-source alternative to research devices (e.g., Brain Products, Empatica, Shimmer, BIOPAC).**

**$500 EmotiBit vs. a $20,000 gold standard Brain Products device — [validation study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4700861)**

**Published and ongoing research studies — [link](https://mailchi.mp/e84c45c6588b/emotibit-update-get-beta-access-5426115?e=922d75e5e6)**

#### Purchase the [All-in-One EmotiBit Bundle](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/all-in-one-emotibit-bundle) or the [EmotiBit + Kit](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/emotibit) to get started!

### 16+ biometric data streams:

- **PPG** (3-wavelength) to derive heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration, oxygen saturation, hydration, and (we believe) much more!
- **EDA / GSR** (electrodermal activity / galvanic skin response) reflecting sympathetic nervous system responses that are driven by cognitive and emotional arousal.
- **9-axis IMU** (accel, gyro, mag) to derive movements, activity, gesture, rotation, and cardinal direction.
- **Body temperature** to assess health as well as emotional reactions.

### What can you do with EmotiBit?

Whether you're a researcher, developer, educator, artist, or just passionate about harnessing your own physiological data, the EmotiBit offers something for everyone!

Get inspired by the example projects in the product images.

- Get immediate feedback about how cognitive and neural processes change your body’s physiology on a moment-by-moment basis.
- Log your physical and psycho-emotional changes throughout the day.
- Track changes in body temperature, blood oxygen levels, and much more to build a long-term record of your biodata.
- Create an audio-visual experience using your own biometric data.
- Data is accurately timestamped for synchronizing with other sensors/systems.
- Use the simple data labeling feature built into the cross-platform EmotiBit data visualizer to leverage data science and machine learning and discover your bio-patterns.

### Do I need a kit?

You need several items in the Essentials Kit to use EmotiBit, including:

- Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi
- Lithium ion battery (400mAh sized to fit between the EmotiBit & Feather)
- High-speed microSD card + reader
- Micro USB cable

**We highly recommend you get an** [Essentials Kit](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/emotibit-essentials-kit?variant=42366414749936) to use EmotiBit out of the box, but we’re offering EmotiBit board-only options without a kit in case you already have all these parts or if you want to adapt the [EmotiBit firmware](https://github.com/EmotiBit/EmotiBit_FeatherWing) to use another Feather or configuration.

We also have an Electrode Kit for folks who want spares and additional flexibility to use EmotiBit in research and other high-use settings.
