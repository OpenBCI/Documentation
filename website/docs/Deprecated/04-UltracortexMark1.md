The electrodes seen in the photos here are dry electrodes from Florida Research Instruments (FRI), found [here](http://fri-fl-shop.com/product/package-of-15-disposable-reusable-dry-electrodes-and-10-disposablereusable-eeg-cup-electrodes-and-5-leads-red-white-green-black-brown/).

The FRI_electrode_mount.stl was modeled to serve as a mechanical mount for the FRI electrodes.

The screws and nuts used to fasten the FRI electrode to the FRI_electrode_mount are:

- Screws: [#2-56 Brass (1/2" length)](http://www.mcmaster.com/#91802a081/=xd3x3s). For variations in head style, see [here](http://www.mcmaster.com/#machine-screws/=xd3ycd)
- Nuts: [#2-56 Brass](https://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=7210)
- Ground clip to fasten between the nuts and solder the electrode to: [Solder Lug](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en/connectors-interconnects/terminals-solder-lug-connectors/1442863)
