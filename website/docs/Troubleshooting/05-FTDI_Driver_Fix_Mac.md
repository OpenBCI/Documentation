title: FTDI Buffer Fix on Mac

:::important
If you are running a Mac that is mid 2015 or newer, you do not need to install the FTDI driver! The included drivers with OS X 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 can handle communications with Cyton and Dongle out of the box.

If you have an older Mac, you can view the deprecated version of this doc [here](..\Deprecated\FTDI_Driver_Fix_Mac_Deprecated.md).
