## EmotiBit

Designed by our good friend Sean Montgomery and his team, [EmotiBit](emotibit.com) can stream 16+ signals from the body (EDA, 3-wavelength PPG, high-res body temperature, humidity and a 9-axis IMU). We think it's the perfect complement to add emotional, physiological and movement data to your EEG recordings!

EmotiBit is a wearable sensor module for capturing high-quality emotional, physiological, and movement data. Easy-to-use and scientifically-validated sensing lets you enjoy wireless data streaming to any platform or direct data recording to the built-in SD card. Customize the Arduino-compatible hardware and fully open-source software to meet any project needs!

The MyoWare muscle sensor can be integrated with both the OpenBCI Cyton and Ganglion. To find out how, check out these tutorials:
* [Cyton + MyoWare](05ThirdParty/01-Myoware/14-MyoWare_Integration.md)
* [Ganglion + MyoWare](05ThirdParty/01-Myoware/15-MyoWare_Integration_Ganglion.md)

## Pulse Sensor

The Pulse Sensor is one of the third-party add-ons offered in our store.

It can be connected to the [Ganglion](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/pre-order-ganglion-board), [Cyton](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/cyton-biosensing-board-8-channel), or any Arduino board to easily obtain your heart rate using [photoplethysmogram (PPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram).


## Wifi Shield

The Wifi Shield is an add-on module that allows you to connect an OpenBCI Board to the GUI and send data over Wifi rather than Radio/BLE.
To learn more about it, see these documents:

* [Wifi Shield](05ThirdParty/03-WiFiShield/01-Wifi.md)
* [OpenBCI Wifi Server](05ThirdParty/03-WiFiShield/03-OpenBCI_Wifi_Server.md)
* [OpenBCI Wifi SDK](05ThirdParty/03-WiFiShield/08-OpenBCI_Wifi_SDK.md)
* [Wifi Programming Tutorial](05ThirdParty/03-WiFiShield/12-Wifi_Programming_Tutorial.md)
